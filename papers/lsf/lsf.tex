\title{How to train and use \tc\ when the line spread function, rotation, or microturbulence is varying from star to star}
\authors{DWH}

\section{Introduction}

\tc\ has amazing successes, which could be listed and cited here.

\tc\ makes the fundamental assumption that stars with the same labels
(atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances) labels will have the
same spectra (up to Gaussian noise).
This isn't always true:
There can be important parameters (for example, rotational velocity
amplitude $v\,\sin i$) that are not among the label set used for
training.
There can also be instrumental issues that make different stars with
identical properties appear different.
For example, in the \apogee\ spectrographs, different fibers have
slightly different line spread functions (\acronym{LSF}s), which lead
to different line widths for the absorption lines.

The nice thing is that a subset of instrumental and stellar-physical
effects are expected to only (to first order) affect the line shapes,
and not their locations or relative equivalent widths.
From here on, we are going to treat all of these effects as
contributing to a single ``effective \acronym{LSF}'' (usually we will
just call this the ``\acronym{LSF}''), which is different (in
principle) for every star.
Here we propose a method for training \tc\ with a training set of
stars that are subject to different effective LSFs, and using \tc\ on
new unlabeled stars that also all have different effective LSFs.

\section{Method}

First some reminders about linear algebra and convolutions and
correlations:
